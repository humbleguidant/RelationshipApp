# Relationship App
This is a relationship app created in React Native, with Firebase DB. It gives tips and advice on how to stay in a positive, healthy relationship. Some of these tips include communication, putting egos aside, and so on. Users can create an account and access the content. The database stores user accounts such as the username, full name, and password. When the user logs in, they are given a main menu with seven options. Conflict Resolution, Expectations, Good For 2, Hot Spots In A Relationship, Listening, Problem Solving, and Warning Signs of Ineffective Communication. If user forgot password, they can reset it on the login page. Passwords are encrypted when creating new account.

# Source Code
